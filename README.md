# LukeDinsdale
Freelance project working with an experienced copywriter, creative director, and UX designer to create a portfolio website.

## Notes from the VC

Josh, Abbey, Luke 

Music inspired applying the record digging aesthetic to their portfolio website.
Landing page: Series of records which can be spooled through via animation, once clicked on a record the sleeve reveals SMP and details of the work. Flip the record and you are given examples of the work 

Having a string landing page is their priority! The rest is of secondary importance and something Josh feels he can help with additionally.

Wanting it to be mobile friendly (think of a way to work this)

Slide deck and Figma are waiting to be sent to us. 

Example of site they sought inspiration from: http://www.sellingthetruth.net/superaveragemegatoms/

They are going to be using hosting site Hostinga via Josh's subscription
